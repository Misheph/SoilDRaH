# Data Summary

@Ares2001 primarily measures tree growth parameters (including litterfall) but also characterized elemental fractions of soil. They use this data to look at factors affecting a specific invasive tree growth in Hawaii including nitrogen and moisture gradients.

## Fit for purpose: HiCSC

This data is identified as a data source for the Hawai'i Soil Organic Carbon Database https://osf.io/hmtv6/ as part of the HiCSC.

- Location: Location region is identified and lat/lon can likely be recovered from figure 1 by regional expert.
- Soil carbon stock: Soil carbon fraction is given but not bulk density nor coarse fraction.
- Soil type: Soil order and history are identified in methods. High/low activity clay status may need inference by regional expert.
- Land use: Land use and history are clearly identified in methods.

# Tables and figures

- Table 
  1) characterists of stands including oc percent
  2) regression coefficents linking diameter at breast height to biomass and leaf area
  3) climate
  4) elevation vs productivity metrics
  5) fertilizer treatement vs productivity over time
  6) fertilizer vs leaf area index
  7) gradient vs plant efficency metrics

- Figure 
  1) stand map overlayed on soil.
  2) elevation vs productivity metrics
  3) nitrogen correlations
  4) light intercept vs nitrogen and water use effiency metrics
  
### Table 1: Stand characteristics

Table 1 was modified to remove the sub-tables and flatted sub-tables in certain columns.

```{r table1}
#| code-fold: true
#| message: false

filename <- table1.file
read_csv(file = filename,
                   skip = 1,
                   col_types = cols(.default = col_character())) |>
  kable(caption = read_csv(file = filename, 
                                 n_max = 1, col_names = 'caption', 
                                 show_col_types = FALSE)$caption)
```

### Table 3: Climate

```{r table3}
#| code-fold: true
#| message: false

filename <- table3.file
read_csv(file = filename,
                   skip = 1,
                   col_types = cols(.default = col_character())) |>
  kable(caption = read_csv(file = filename, 
                                 n_max = 1, col_names = 'caption', 
                                 show_col_types = FALSE)$caption)

# Working notes (KTB)

## Data Rescue Plan

- [x] describe files in human readable form inside ReadMe
- [x] description with Git issue with link
- [x] add contribution yaml
- [x] create excel sheet with Table 1 and 3
- [x] export excel table to csv
- [x] copy over methods section into markdown 
  - started, PDF doesn't copy but there is an html version which is incomplete and error ridden. Ended up with alot of retyping.
- [x] pull down citations in methods section to bib file
- [x] add in citation links to methods
- [x] cross check with second transcriber for tables and methods
- [ ] submit to independent review
- [ ] archive on SoilDRaH
