# METHODS

## Study sites

The study area is located on the island of Hawaii’s Hamakua coast (19 degrees 30 minutes N, 155 degrees 15 minutes W).
Average annual precipitation of 3.0–4.6 m is evenly distributed throughout the year, and average annual temperature is 21 degrees C, with little seasonal variation [@DeBell1989].
Elevation ranges from 15 to 400 m, with gentle slopes of 0–15%.
Soils are classified as isothermic Typic Hydrudands of the Akaka and Kaiwiki series [@Sato1973].
These volcanic ash soils are characterized by amorphous noncrystalline hydrous alumina and iron oxides mineralogy [@Mizota1989].
Typically, these soils have low bulk density (approximately 0.35 kg/L, oven-dried basis) and a very fine structure that adsorbs large amounts of water and humus [@Wada1976].

Five paired sites were located containing *Eucalyptus saligna* (Sm.) plantations established on, and adjacent to, abandoned cane fields.
Since 1920, the cane fields were fertilized with 85, 75, and 110 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> of N, P, and K, respectively, and were tilled to 40 cm every 4–6 yr.
Since 1955, cane fields were also limed with CaCO<sub>3</sub> at 700 kg/ha every two years.
The *Eucalyptus* plantations were planted at 3 x 3 m spacing and were fertilized for the first three years [@Whitesell1992].
Understory species in all *Eucalyptus* sites contained a mixture of C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> vegetation.
Two wildland forest sites (never under management), dominated by introduced *Guava* and native *Koa acacia*, were also found adjacent to cane plantations at Amaulu and Kamae (Table 1).
At Amaulu, the adjacent *Eucalyptus* plantation was established on soils that were never in cane production; it was analyzed separately from the five paired cane and *Eucalyptus* sites.
The other wildland forest site (Kamae) had an adjacent *Eucalyptus* plantation on a former cane site.
All sites were within 17 km of each other, with similar history and characteristics (Table 1).

## Soil sampling

In each site, three soil cores were taken every 5 m along a transect 10 m from the plantation edge.
A parallel transect was located in the cane field 10 m from the edge of the plantation.
Each core was 6 cm in diameter and, in most cases, 1 m in length.
The cores were divided into 0–5, 5–10, 10–15, 15–20, 20–25, 25–40, 40–55, 55–70, 70–85, and 85–100 cm depths, and then were air-dried and transported to Colorado State University for analyses.

Soil samples were passed through a 2-mm sieve and oven-dried at 70 degrees C to a constant mass.
Bulk density was calculated by dividing the oven-dry mass of the <2 mm fraction by the volume of the core segment.
From each site, bulk density was averaged over three cores for each layer in abandoned cane fields, *Eucalyptus* plantation, or wildland forest.

## Carbon analyses

Because soils had been limed to increase cane production, we acidified soil samples to remove any residual CaCO<sub>3</sub>.
A composite 10-g sample from the three cores for each depth and each site of *Eucalyptus*, cane, or wildland forest soil was placed into a 40-mL centrifuge tube.
We added 15 mL 0.1 mol/L HCl and placed the tubes on a reciprocating shaker for 12 h.
Tubes were then centrifuged for 20 min at 15000 rpm and the supernatant was aspirated off.
We added 25 mL deionized water to each tube, centrifuged, and then aspirated off the supernatant.
This sequence was repeated twice.
Finally, the entire soil pellet was transferred to a tin container, was oven-dried at 70 degrees C to a constant mass, and then was ground to a fine powder.

Percent carbon was determined on a CHN analyzer by dry combustion (LECO-1000, LECO Corporation, St. Joseph, Michigan, USA).
Total soil C (in megagrams per hectare) was calculated by multiplying the C concentration by the bulk density and by depth of the soil layer.

The C isotope composition was determined utilizing the VG isochrom-NA stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (VG, Middlewich, UK).
The C isotopic composition was expressed as delta values relative to the PDB standard and was calculated as follows:

$\delta^{13}C (\text{per mil}) (R_{sample} - R_{standard}) \times 10^3$ (1)

where delta <sup>13</sup>C is the per mil (‰) difference between the <sup>13</sup>C content of the sample and the standard, and R is the mass <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>/<sup>12</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> ratio of the sample or standard.
Each sample was run twice and the two values were averaged.
Fewer than 5% of the sample duplicates were not within 0.4‰; these were run a third time and all three values were averaged.

The TC pool was divided into carbon derived from C<sub>3</sub> or C<sub>4</sub> vegetation.
Percentage TC derived from cane (% SOC<sub>4</sub>) and percentage TC derived from C<sub>3</sub> (% SOC<sub>3</sub>) plants for each layer were calculated as follows [@Vitorello1989]:

$\% SOC_4 = (\delta - \delta_o / \delta_c - \delta_o )100$ (2)

$\% SOC_3 = 100 - % SOC_4$ (3)

where delta is the delta<sup>13</sup>C value of the soil sample, delta<sub>o</sub> is the delta<sup>13</sup>C value of soil from the wildland forest soil, and delta<sub>c</sub> is the delta<sup>13</sup>C value of a composite sample of cane litter and roots from all sites (-11.52‰; M. Bashkin, *unpublished data*).
A sensitivity analysis using -14.52‰ and -8.52‰ for delta<sub>c</sub> showed a shift in percentage of SOC<sub>4</sub> in cane fields of +3.3% and -2.3%, respectively.

The percentages of SOC<sub>4</sub> and SOC<sub>3</sub> were multiplied by TC to obtain C (in megagrams per hectare) derived from *Eucalyptus* (SOC<sub>3</sub>) and cane (SOC<sub>4</sub>) vegetation in each soil layer.
Net carbon change of SOC<sub>3</sub>, SOC<sub>4</sub>, and TC due to 10–13 yr tree growth was calculated as the difference between the pools in the *Eucalyptus* plantation minus respective pools from the adjacent cane site for each layer.
A key assumption was that no substantial losses occurred from the wildland soil C prior to cane cultivation.
We did not correct for changes in bulk density [@Veldkamp1994] because there was no difference in bulk density between cane and *Eucalyptus* (*P* = 0.98, paired *t* test).

## Statistical analyses

Land use had no effect on delta<sup>13</sup>C values below 55 cm (Fig. 1), so only values from 0–55 cm soil depth were used for analyses.
Similarly, @Detwiler1986 reported that most studies found no effect of land use on soil C below 40 cm in the tropics.
TC, SOC<sub>4</sub>, and SOC<sub>3</sub> were tested for significant differences by using a split-plot ANOVA with site x land use x depth as error terms [@SAS1987].
For statistical comparisons, the land use term refers only to cane vs. *Eucalyptus* management; wildland forests were not included because of insufficient replication.
Data were tested for differences based on the entire measured layer (0–55 cm), or were partitioned into the surface layer (0–10 cm) and lower layer (10–55 cm), although data for each depth are reported.
When there was a significant interaction between land use x depth, the main effect of land use was determined with Bonferroni-adjusted, paired *t* tests to control for Type 1 error.
Two-tailed tests were used for TC and one-tailed tests were used for SOC<sub>4</sub> (decreased under *Eucalyptus*) and SOC<sub>3</sub> (increased under *Eucalyptus*).
