	abstract = {Millions of hectares of tropical forest are cleared annually for agriculture, pasture, shifting cultivation and timber. One result of these changes in land use is the release of CO2 from the cleared vegetation and soils. Although there is uncertainty as to the size of this release, it appears to be a major source of atmospheric CO2, second only to the release from the combustion of fossil fuels. This study estimates the release of CO2 from tropical soils using a computer model that simulates land use change in the tropics and data on (1) the carbon content of forest soils before clearing; (2) the changes in the carbon content under the various types of land use; and (3) the area of forest converted to each use. It appears that the clearing and use of tropical soils affects their carbon content to a depth of about 40 cm. Soils of tropical closed forests contain approximately 6.7 kg C ·m-2; soils of tropical open forests contain approximately 5.2 kg C ·m-2 to this depth. The cultivation of tropical soils reduces their carbon content by 40{\%} 5 yr after clearing; the use of these soils for pasture reduces it by about 20{\%}. Logging in tropical forests appears to have little effect on soil carbon. The carbon content of soils used by shifting cultivators returns to the level found under primary forest about 35 yr after abandonment. The estimated net release of carbon from tropical soils due to land use change was 0.11--0.26 ×1015 g in 1980.},

@article{Veldkamp1994,
	abstract = {Abstract Deforestation is one of the main reasons for the global net release of CO2 from soil to atmosphere. Estimates of CO2 emission from soils are highly variable, mainly due to limited data of C dynamics in soils after forest clearing. The objective of this study was to calculate the changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) storage after deforestation in three soil types in the Atlantic Zone of Costa Rica with help of the δ13C method. Changes in bulk density, which normally accompany land use changes, had a profound influence on the results of the calculations. Deforestation, followed by 25 yr of pasture, caused a net loss of 21.8 Mg ha−1 in SOC for an Eutric Hapludand and 1.5 Mg ha−1 for an Oxic Humitropept. The SOC changes in time were studied on a deforestation sequence on an Andic Humitropept. In the first years after forest clearing, decomposition of tree roots caused an extra input of SOC, which influenced the δ13C signal. Decomposition of forest C and increase of pasture C were mathematically described for several depths. A considerable influence of depth on decomposition rates was found. The strong stabilization of organic C by Al-organic matter complexes probably caused the relatively small net C loss from SOC since forest clearing.},

@article{Vitorello1989,
	abstract = {Abstract Soil carbon (C) distribution, natural 13C abundances and their changes as a consequence of cropping were studied in three neighboring areas on an Oxisol from Brazil. One site (T0) was under forest, while the two other sites (T12 and T50) had been deforested, then cultivated with sugar cane for 12 and 50 yr, respectively. Soil morphological, chemical and mineralogical characteristics in all three sites were very similar. Total C content of the 0.06-m layer of T0 was twice that of T12 and T50, then decreased sharply with depth, to values similar to the other profiles. Delta 13C had practically constant values of −25.1, −22.8, and −20.4‰, throughout the 0 to 0.30-m layer of T0, T12, and T50 respectively. These values increased in deeper layers, to about −17‰, due to increased humification and possibly to deposition of organic matter from a former 13C-rich vegetation. The 0.10- to 0.20-m layer was separated into particle-size fractions and alkaline extract. Carbon contents decreased from T0 to T50 in the sand-size fractions and alkaline extracts, but did not change in the clay-size fractions. Delta 13C values were used to estimate the proportions of C derived from forest (Cdff) and from sugar cane (Cdfc). Carbon derived from sugar cane represented 17.3 $\pm$ 3.2\% and 40.5 $\pm$ 2.2\% of total C in T12 and T50, respectively. It reached its maximum value (67 $\pm$ 3.7\%) in the coarse sand fraction of T12 and T50 and decreased with decreasing fraction size, to 13.8 $\pm$ 9.4\% and 30.5 $\pm$ 6.5\% in the fine clay fractions of T12 and T50, respectively. Thus, Cdff persisted mainly in the clay-size fraction.},

	abstract = {The mineralogy of the clay fractions separated from the B horizons of two Hydrandepts (Hilo and Akaka soils), a Torrox (Molokai soil) and a Humitropept (Kolekole soil) was determined by a combination of methods. The Hydrandept B horizons were characterized by predominance of hydrous non-crystalline alumina and iron oxides associated with considerable amounts of humus and with very small amounts of silica. Allophane, allophane-like constituents and imogolite were present but in minor amounts. Gibbsite, goethite, chlorite and illite were also present as accessory minerals. The Torrox and Humitropept B horizons were characterized by predominance of kaolinite, hematite and goethite. The iron oxide minerals were present as fine particles (40--80 A diameter) often clustered to form larger aggregates. Neither imogolite nor allophane and allophane-like constituents were detected. Considerable amounts of dithionite-citrate soluble Al and humus were, however, present in the Humitropept B horizon, which may reflect the effect of an admixture of volcanic ash to the parent material.},

@article{DeBell1989,
	abstract = {Plantations of Eucalpytus saligna Sm. grow rapidly in Hawaii, but supplemental nitrogen (N) is required on many sites. Because of the high cost of synthetic N fertilizer, mixed species plantings in which N is added by Albizia falcataria (L.) Fosb., an N2-fixing tree, are being tested on the island of Hawaii. Five combinations of Eucalyptus and Albizia were compared with each other, with pure Albizia, and with pure Eucalyptus fertilized periodically with nitrogen. The test is a randomized block design with four replications on the wet, Hamakua coast. At 48 months, Eucalyptus trees in the mixed plantings containing 34\% or more Albizia were equal to or larger than those in the pure, fertilized stands. Total dry yields ranged from 109 ton/ha in pure Albizia plantings to 67 ton/ha in mixed species plantings with only 11\% Albizia. Yields in the mixed plantings with 34 to 66\% Albizia were 103 to 105 ton/ha, whereas yield in the pure, fertilized Eucalyptus stand was 94 ton/ha. Nitrogen concentration of Eucalyptus foliage increased as the amount of Albizia increased in the stand; and in mixed plantings with 34\% or more Albizia, foliar N concentration exceeded that of the pure, fertilized, Eucalyptus treatment. Phosphorus levels in Eucalyptus foliage similarly increased as amounts of Albizia increased in the stand. At 48 months, total N was higher in soils of mixed species and pure Albizia plantings than in soils of the pure, fertilized Eucalyptus treatment. Albizia can provide the N needed by Eucalyptus in high-yielding bioenergy plantations along the Hamakua coast. For. Sci. 35(1):64-75.},
