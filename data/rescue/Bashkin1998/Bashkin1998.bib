abstract = {Afforestation in the tropics may sequester soil C and has been proposed as a management tool to aid in controlling rising levels of atmospheric CO2. We measured changes in soil C following afforestation of sugarcane fields with fast-growing Eucalyptus saligna (Sm.) plantations in Hawaii. Using stable C isotopes, we estimated the contributions to changes in total soil C that were due to the loss of C from the prior cane cultivation, and to the gain of C from the new Eucalyptus plantations. Total soil C 10–13 yr after afforestation was 114 and 113 Mg/ha, respectively, in the Eucalyptus and cane plantation. Eucalyptus increased total soil C in the 0–10 cm layer by 11.5 Mg/ha, but that was offset by a loss of 10.1 Mg/ha of cane-derived C from the 10–55 cm layer. The net effect on soil C of afforestation of cultivated lands depends not only on new C gained, but also on C lost from the previous management.},
