@article{Bashkin1998,
	abstract = {Afforestation in the tropics may sequester soil C and has been proposed as a management tool to aid in controlling rising levels of atmospheric CO2. We measured changes in soil C following afforestation of sugarcane fields with fast-growing Eucalyptus saligna (Sm.) plantations in Hawaii. Using stable C isotopes, we estimated the contributions to changes in total soil C that were due to the loss of C from the prior cane cultivation, and to the gain of C from the new Eucalyptus plantations. Total soil C 10--13 yr after afforestation was 114 and 113 Mg/ha, respectively, in the Eucalyptus and cane plantation. Eucalyptus increased total soil C in the 0--10 cm layer by 11.5 Mg/ha, but that was offset by a loss of 10.1 Mg/ha of cane-derived C from the 10--55 cm layer. The net effect on soil C of afforestation of cultivated lands depends not only on new C gained, but also on C lost from the previous management.},

@article{Vitorello1989,
	abstract = {Abstract Soil carbon (C) distribution, natural 13C abundances and their changes as a consequence of cropping were studied in three neighboring areas on an Oxisol from Brazil. One site (T0) was under forest, while the two other sites (T12 and T50) had been deforested, then cultivated with sugar cane for 12 and 50 yr, respectively. Soil morphological, chemical and mineralogical characteristics in all three sites were very similar. Total C content of the 0.06-m layer of T0 was twice that of T12 and T50, then decreased sharply with depth, to values similar to the other profiles. Delta 13C had practically constant values of −25.1, −22.8, and −20.4‰, throughout the 0 to 0.30-m layer of T0, T12, and T50 respectively. These values increased in deeper layers, to about −17‰, due to increased humification and possibly to deposition of organic matter from a former 13C-rich vegetation. The 0.10- to 0.20-m layer was separated into particle-size fractions and alkaline extract. Carbon contents decreased from T0 to T50 in the sand-size fractions and alkaline extracts, but did not change in the clay-size fractions. Delta 13C values were used to estimate the proportions of C derived from forest (Cdff) and from sugar cane (Cdfc). Carbon derived from sugar cane represented 17.3 $\pm$ 3.2\% and 40.5 $\pm$ 2.2\% of total C in T12 and T50, respectively. It reached its maximum value (67 $\pm$ 3.7\%) in the coarse sand fraction of T12 and T50 and decreased with decreasing fraction size, to 13.8 $\pm$ 9.4\% and 30.5 $\pm$ 6.5\% in the fine clay fractions of T12 and T50, respectively. Thus, Cdff persisted mainly in the clay-size fraction.},

@article{Binkley1992,
	abstract = {Experimental plantations of pure Eucalyptus saligna (Sm.), pure Albizia falcataria (L.) Fosberg (a nitrogen-fixing species), and five proportions of mixtures of these species were examined at age 6 for biomass, production, nutrient cycling in litterfall, and resource-use efficiencies. Biomass was greatest in the 34\% Eucalyptus/66\% Albizia treatment, averaging 174 Mg/ha, compared with 148 Mg/ha in the fertilized pure Eucalyptus treatment and 132 Mg/ha for the pure Albizia treatment. The 34\% Eucalyptus/66\% Albizia treatment also showed the greatest aboveground net primary production (52 Mg ha-1 yr-1) and annual increment (39 Mg ha-1 yr-1). The N and P content of above-ground litterfall ranged from 35 and 3.5 kg ha-1 yr-1 in pure Eucalyptus to 240 and 9.5 kg ha-1 yr-1 in pure Albizia. Nutrient-use efficiency, defined as Mg of ANPP/kg of nutrient in fine litterfall, was greater for Eucalyptus (1.1 for N, 13.4 for P) than for Albizia (0.2 for N, 5.7 for P). Light-use efficiency ranged from about 14 kJ/MJ of intercepted light in the pure Albizia treatment, to 17 kJ/MJ in the pure Eucalyptus treatment, to 18 in the 34\% Eucalyptus/66\% Albizia treatment. The patterns of productivity across the mixtures resulted from the combination of (1) greater nutrient use efficiency of Eucalyptus, (2) greater nutrient cycling under Albizia, and (3) greater light capture and high use efficiency in mixed stands.
