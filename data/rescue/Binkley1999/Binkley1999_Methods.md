# METHODS

The study site is a 4-ha plantation of *E. saligna*, 13 km NNE of downtown Hilo, HI (19째50'28.1" N, 155째7'28.3" W) at 350 m elevation with a mean annual temperature of 21째C and an average rainfall of $\approx$ 4 m yr<sup>-1</sup> [@Binkley1992].
The slopes are modest (<5%), with deep (>2 m), acidic (pH 5-6 in water) soils of the Kaiwiki thixotropic, isothermic Typic Hydrandepts.
Sugarcane was cropped on this site for more than 80 yr.
Beginning in about 1920, the routine management of the soil included applications every 2 yr of 85 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>, 75 kg P ha<sup>-1</sup>, and 110 kg K ha<sup>-1</sup>.
After 1955, 700 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> of lime was added to the biannual fertilization treatment.
The last sugarcane crop was harvested $\approx$ 1 yr prior to the planting of eucalyptus seedlings (May 1994).
The site was fallow for $\approx$ 9 mo, and then plowed to turn under the developing vegetation.
Revegetation was allowed to progress for 3 mo, followed by broadcast application of herbicide (Roundup [isopropylamine salt of *N*-(phosphono-methyl) glycine]) just prior to planting seedlings.
Eucalyptus seedlings were grown for 6 mo in a greenhouse, and selected for uniform size ($\approx$ 20 - 25 cm in height) prior to planting in late April and early May of 1994.
The experimental design consists of 30 by 30 m plots with trees at two spacings (1 by 1 m and 3 by 3 m) receiving three fertilization regimes in three completely randomized blocks.
Two of the fertilization treatments were identical and serve as the controls for this study (one set will have a different treatment in a future study).
The "control" fertilization regime involved fertilization with N+P+K+Ca in holes at 1 by 1 m spacings (Table 1), and a broadcast application of the same amount at 7 mo.
Total fertilizer application to the control plots (representing current operational rates) was: 310 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> as urea, 130 kg P ha<sup>-1</sup>, and 125 kg Ca ha<sup>-1</sup> as triplesuperphosphate, 260 kg K ha<sup>-1</sup> as KCl, and 100 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> of Granusol 2GB5 micronutrient fertilizer: 50 mg Mn g<sup>-1</sup>, 50 mg Zn g<sup>-1</sup>, 50 mg Mg g<sup>-1</sup>, 15 mg Fe g<sup>-1</sup>, 5 mg B g<sup>-1</sup> (5% Mn, 5% Zn, 5% Mg, 5% Fe, 1.5% Cu, and 0.5% B).
The high fertilization treatment matched the fertilization of the control plots at 0 and 7 mo, followed by additional fertilization 4 times yr<sup>-1</sup>, for total applications of: 700 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>, 300 kg P ha<sup>-1</sup>, 580 kg K ha<sup>-1</sup>, 320 kg Ca ha<sup>-1</sup>, and 200 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> of Granusol.
The high fertilization treatment was designed to minimize any nutrient limitation on eucalyptus growth.

Soils were sampled at the time of planting (April 1994) in three pits per plot, at permanently located sites.
Pits were excavated to about the 40-cm depth, and soil sampled with a trowel from the 0- to 15-cm depth, and the 15- to 30-cm depth.
Bulk density was determined from samples of known volume taken from the midpoint of each depth.
Samples were placed in plastic bags and returned to the lab for measurement; all values are reported on an oven-dried basis (100째C to a constant weight).
In January of 1997, the soils were resampled within 30 cm of each permanent sampling point.
The resampling was performed with a 65-cm-long corer (i.d. 53 mm), with a plastic sleeve lining to allow for precise separation of soil depths and determination of bulk density.
Soil pH was measured the day of collection in 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> with a fresh weight/volume ratio of 1:2.
The suspensions were swirled, and the pH electrode was placed in suspended supernatant.
Five-gram subsamples were also extracted the day of collection with 50 mL of 1 *M* NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>, and the extracts frozen for later determination of concentrations of Ca, Mg, K, and Al by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP) at the Colorado State University Soil Testing Laboratory.
Soils were were air dried and stored.
For total C and N concentrations, 2-g subsamples were acidified with 10 mL of 0.2 *M* HCl to remove any residual carbonates from previous fertilization or liming treatments, and then neutralized with an average of 30 drops of 3 *M* NaOH.
Total C and N on the carbonate-free samples were determined with a LECO 1000 CN analyzer (Leco Corp., St. Joseph, MI), with all samples run at the same time (in 1997) to insure consistent, comparable values for both sampling periods.

The ratios of C isotopes were measured with a VG isochrom-NA stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Fisons Instruments, Milan, Italy), and the pool of C derived from sugarcane (a C4 grass) was calculated (after @Vitorello1989) as:
$$ \%C4 = (\delta - \delta_o / \delta_c - \delta_o)100$$
where $\delta$ is the natural abundance, the $\delta^{13}C$ of the soil sample ($\delta^{13}C$ = per mil difference between the <sup>13</sup>C content of the sample and the PeeDee Belmnite [PDB] standard), $\delta_o$ is the $\delta^{13}C$ of soil samples with no C from C4 plants, and $\delta_c$ is the $\delta^{13}C$ of C4 (sugarcane) plant material.
The value for soil samples with no C input from C4 plants was taken as -25.5%$_o$, based on values from native Hawaiian forests within a few kilometers of this site (@Bashkin1998).
The $\delta^{13}C$ of sugarcane material was taken as -11.5%$_o$ (also from @Bashkin1998).
The percentage of the soil C derived from C3 plants (including old C from presugarcane period and new eucalyptus C) was calculated as:

$$ \%C3 = 100 - \%C4 $$

The availabilities of N and P were indexed with on site ionexchange resin bags.
Resin bags were constructed with two sections: one with anion resin (14 mL of Sybron IONAC ASBIPOH, Sybron International, Milwaukee, WI), and one with cation resin (14 mL of Sybron IONAC c-251 H+).
Each section of the resin bag was about 4 by 4 cm, with a band of heat applied glue separating the pouches.
For the 1997 sampling, an additional section of cation resin was included for each bag to provide an index of available cation nutrients.
Ten bags were placed at 2-m intervals along a transect in each plot for the month of January in 1995, 1996, and 1997.
In each of these periods, rainfall (measured on site) was between 300 and 400 mm mo<sup>-1</sup>.
In the laboratory, the anion resin and one pouch of the cation resin were combined and extracted with 100 mL of 2 *M* KCl.
Concentrations of ammonium and nitrate were determined colorimetrically on a Perstorp autoanalyzer, and P concentrations were determined colorimetrically on a Lachat continuous-flow injection analyzer.
The extra cation resin pouch in 1997 was extracted with 100 mL of 2 *M* NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> and the extract analyzed by ICP for Ca, Mg, and K.

Soil concentrations were converted to an area (square meters) basis by multiplying by bulk density and sampling depth.
We were primarily interested in the changes in soils with time, and whether these changes differed by treatments (fertilization and tree spacing).
The values for the three pits per plot were averaged to provide a single value for each depth in each plot.
Changes in soils with time were tested with paired *t*-tests (within-plot pairing over time, SYSTAT 7.0), and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using pooled variances (variances did not differ between treatments or sampling times).
Most of the effects of tree spacing and fertilization were not significant (P > 0.1), so we present the majority of the data as averages across treatments for each time period.
Where treatment effects were significant, we discuss the averages separately.
