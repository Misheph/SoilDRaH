# Data Summary

@Binkley1999 looks at soil carbon stocks under ~3 years of Eucalytus plantation from sugarcane. They use this data to conclude that there was no change in carbon stocks but there was a shift from sugarcane derived carbon to Eucalytus.

This paper documents changes in Hawaiian soil after 32 months of development of a eucalyptus plantation.
Soil C was found to not change significantly, suggesting that expectations of C accumulation due to afforestation may need to be reduced.
Rapid changes in soil are examined here as: (1) Soil fertility may affect tree growth rate, and (2) Changes in soil C must be accounted for to predict root production following an efflux in CO2.

## Fit for purpose: HiCSC

This data is identified as a data source for the Hawai'i Soil Organic Carbon Database https://osf.io/hmtv6/ as part of the HiCSC.

- Location: The exact lat/lon is given in the methods section, although it is unclear if this is the location of downtown Hilo or the site. Years of observation is given in text.
- Soil carbon stock: Carbon stock is given in Table 1 at 0 months and 32 months of plantation. Depth of sample included, bulk density determined but unclear where the data is.
- Soil type: Soils of the Kaiwiki thixotropic, isothermic Typic Hydrandepts. Unclear if "Kaiwiki thixotropic" qualifies as soil type here, but the location might be precise enough to extract from soil maps
- Land Use: Detailed soil history and classification provided in methods section. Land use largely characterized by eucalyptus afforestation.

# Tables and figures

- Table 
  1) Soil Properties at Time of Planting and 32 Months after (C, N, pH, Ca, Mg, K+, Al)
  2)  Nutrient Accumulation on Ion-Exchange Resin Bags (age, fertilization, nutrients)
  
- Figure
  1) Loss of Soil C from Sugar Cane (C4) matched with gain of soil C derived from Eucalyptus (C3). bar plot of soil carbon source parition.

### Table 1

Table 1 was modified by filling in blanks with `NA` and down filling the Age column.
There were two rows in the 'K' column that indicated control vs fertilizer, I split this into two separate columns.
The CI for pH was not aggregated to 0-30 but reported for 0-15 and 15-30, I concatenated both values with a ';' separate into one entry.

```{r table1}
#| code-fold: true
#| message: false

filename <- table1.file
read_csv(file = filename,
                   skip = 1,
                   col_types = cols(.default = col_character())) |>
  kable(caption = read_csv(file = filename, 
                                 n_max = 1, col_names = 'caption', 
                                 show_col_types = FALSE)$caption)

# Working notes 

## Data Rescue Plan

- [x] describe files in human readable form inside ReadMe
- [x] description with Git issue with link
- [x] add contribution yaml
- [x] create excel sheet with Table 1
- [x] export excel table to csv
- [x] copy over methods section into markdown
- [x] pull down citations in methods section to bib file
- [x] add in citation links to methods
- [x] cross check with second transcriber for tables and methods
- [ ] submit to independent review
- [ ] archive on SoilDRaH

# Level 0: raw data reads

The Level 0 data in this package include the tables above (Table 1 and 3) as well as the methods section.
Here we draft the read function that will be transferred to the R scripts.
In the future this draft will be echoed from the R scripts.
