# Methods

## *Study plots*

We established 2-4 study plots within a 1-ha area at each of the field sites except for Olaa; several of the measurements took place in these study plots, while others were carried out in the 1-ha area surrounding them.
Two 10-m-radius plots were established at Thurston, Kohala, and Kolekole; two 15-m-radius plots were used at Laupahoehoe (because of the larger trees at that site).
At Kokee we used four 10 x 10 m plots that were already defined for controls in a fertilization study [@Herbert1995].
All sampling at Olaa took place in a 1-ha area.

## *P fractionation*

We sampled 5-7 horizons from each of 10 soil pits at all sites on the chronosequence.
Pits were randomly distributed over ≈0.5 ha at each site, encompassing the study plots.
We combined analogous horizons from the 10 pits at each site and refrigerated the samples for up to 2 mo before undertaking the P fractionations.

We used a version of the phosphorus fractionation described by @Hedley1982 with modifications by @Tiessen1993.
Duplicate samples of 0.5-0.6 g of soil (triplicates for Olaa) were weighed out at field moisture into 50 mL polypropylene centrifuge tubes.
We determined oven dry masses on separate soil samples.
Before weighing out organic horizons, we separated finer particulate organic matter from undecomposed structural material by suspending ≈30 g of soil organic matter in a 600-mL beaker filled to 250 mL with deionized H$_2$O (H. Tiessen, *personal communication*).
We then sonicated the suspension at 175 W for 2 min, and poured off suspended fine organic matter into 250-mL centrifuge bottles.
After repeated rinsings and decantation of fine organic matter from root, leaf, and other structural material, we centrifuged the suspension at 1.6 x 10$^4$ m/s$^2$ for 20 min, decanted the water, and sampled the fine organic matter for analysis.

We sequentially extracted soil samples using the following extraction agents: anion exchange resin (0.4 g Biorad 1-X8, 20-50 mesh resin beads, Cl$^-$ form in 86 mesh [≈190-µm openings] polyester bags), 0.5 mol/L NaHCO$_3$ adjusted to pH 8.5 with 5 mol/L NaOH, 0.1 mol/L NaOH, a second round of 0.1 mol/L NaOH after sample sonication at 175 W for 2 min, 1 mol/L HCl, concentrated HCl (hot) [@Tiessen1993], and a final digestion of remaining soil materials in concentrated H$_2$SO$_4$ (boiling) with repeated additions of a 30% H$_2$O$_2$ solution.
The Olaa soil fractionations, which were carried out at a later time than for the other soils, involved the same procedure except that we excluded the sonicated NaOH and hot HCl steps.
Extractions took 16 h in a home-built, end-over-end soil rotisserie.
We collected supernatant by centrifuging samples at 1.7 x 10$^4$ m/s$^2$ (3200 rpm) for 5 min in a clinical centrifuge, followed by filtering samples through a 0.45-µm micropore filter.
After filtration, we recovered as much of the soil from the filter as possible by gently scraping with a clean spatula, and then rinsing the soil from the spatula back into the centrifuge tube with the subsequent extract.
We determined total P(organic + inorganic) in the NaHCO$_3$, NaOH, sonicated NaOH, and hot, concentrated HCl extracts by potassium persulfate digestion.
Organic phosphorus fractions were estimated by subtracting inorganic P from the total P measured in each of these extracts.
We adjusted the pH of final solutions to ≈4.5 using *p*-nitrophenol or a pH meter, and added standard acid molybdate reagents [@Olsen1982] to develop color in the samples, and measured P at 712 nm on a spectrophotometer.

The P fractionation scheme was designed to extract the most labile P first, with subsequent extracts removing P that is decreasingly available to the biota.
In brief, labile, inorganic P (P$_i$) was extracted by the anion exchange resin and NaHCO$_3$.
Labile, organic phosphorus (P$_o$) was extracted by NaHCO$_3$ and NaOH.
Conventionally, the bicarbonate fraction is considered to be the most labile P$_o$; however this assumption is now being questioned as it has been shown not to extract relatively labile P$_o$ associated with cellulose (H. Tiessen, *personal communication*).
Non-occluded P$_i$ was extracted from surfaces of Fe and Al minerals with NaOH.
Calcium phosphates (presumably apatites) were removed with 1 mol/L HCl.
Occluded P$_i$ was extracted with NaOH after sonication with hot concentrated HCl, and the final H$_2$SO$_4$/H$_2$O$_2$ digest.
Protected and recalcitrant P$_o$ was extracted in the sonicated NaOH and hot concentrated HCl extracts.
For thorough reviews of the P pools believed to be extracted with each step, as well as background references for the different fractions, see @Stewart1982, @Sharpley1987, @Tiessen1991, and @Tiessen1993.
We realize that the chemical extractions and digests of this and other phosphorus fractionations represent approximations of theoretical pools, but they have proved useful in practice ([@Tiessen1984], [@Tiessen1992], [@LajthaandSchlesinger1988], [@Frossard1989], [@Schoenau1989]).

We transformed the P fractionation data to units comparable with the @Walker1976 model (Fig. 1) by first multiplying P mass per fraction by the bulk density and depth of the corresponding horizon.
Next we summed all horizons to 50 cm to estimate the P associated with a given fraction per profile.
We then combined fractions to approximate the phosphorus pools depicted in the @Walker1976 model as follows: resin P$_i$ + NaHCO$_3$-P$_i$ + NaOH-P$_i$ = non-occluded P$_i$; NaHCO$_3$-P$_o$ + NaOH-P$_o$ + sonic NaOH-P$_o$ + hot HCl P$_o$ = P$_o$; HCl-P$_i$ = calcium phosphates (P$_{Ca}$); sonic NaOH-P$_i$ + hot HCl P$_i$ + residual (H$_2$SO$_4$/H$_2$O$_2$) P$_i$ = occluded P.
Since the Olaa fractionation did not include sonic NaOH or hot HCl fractions, all residual P$_o$ and P$_i$ was measured in the final H$_2$SO$_4$/H$_2$O$_2$ digest.
We interpolated the percentage of P$_o$ in the Olaa residual P to be 30% using the ratios of residual P$_o$ to total residual P at Thurston and Laupahoehoe.

The profile depth we compared between sites was 50 cm, whereas the soil of the 300-yr-old Thurston site was only ≈38 cm deep.
To allow a meaningful comparison between Thurston and other sites, we estimated the P content of 12 cm of the underlying pahoehoe parent material at Thurston, and added it to the primary P$_{Ca}$ fraction (HCl-extractable P) of the overlying soil.
In making this estimate we assumed the pahoehoe to have a bulk density of 1.3 g/cm$^3$ (J. Lockwood, *personal communication*), and a P$_2$O$_5$ content of 0.25% [@Wright1971].
Before this adjustment, the 0-38 cm Thurston profile was 70% P$_{Ca}$, while after adding the pahoehoe P, the profile P$_{Ca}$ increased to 82%.

## *Other soil analyses*

We determined total nitrogen and carbon on all horizons sampled at each site using a Carlo Erba C:H:N analyzer.
To convert the data to a mass per volume form, we multiplied the N and C mass values of each horizon by the corresponding bulk densities and horizon depths.
The total C and N in each horizon was then summed to a depth of 50 cm.

We used the clod method [@Blake1986] with paraffin as a coating to estimate bulk densities of the different soil horizons.
We analyzed three well-preserved clods selected from each composite soil sample for bulk density analysis.
We used the mean bulk density of each horizon in our calculations of P fractions and total profile C and N.

Soil pH was determined in a 2:1 ratio of deionized H$_2$O : soil.
The soil water was allowed to equilibrate for 1 h, and pH values were measured using an Orion Sure-flow combination pH probe.

We used resin bags buried in the field [@Lajtha1988] to provide a relative measure of soil nutrient availability in these sites.
Three grams of anion exchange resin (Biorad, AG 1-X8, 20-50 mesh, Cl$^-$ form) and cation exchange resin (Biorad, AG 50W-X8, 20-50 mesh, H$^+$ form) were weighed into separate 30-cm$^2$ bags of 86 mesh (≈190-µm openings) polyester.
In the field an anion and a cation resin bag were tethered to a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe with heavy-duty cotton-polyester button thread, and buried in a horizontal orientation at 4-7 cm depth.
In burying the resin bags, care was taken to maintain the structure of the topsoil that overlaid the bags.
Except at Kokee, five resin bag locations were evenly distributed on the forest floor under the *Metrosideros* canopy at each plot within the site.
At Kokee, the resin bags were distributed at three locations in two plots, and four locations in one plot.
Resin bags were collected monthly, and fresh bags were tethered to the same PVC pole, but not buried in the same place as the previous month's bags.
We used regenerated resin bags until they were irreversibly discolored by organic acids (up to 3 times).
In standard recovery trials we found regenerated bags to have P recovery rates comparable to new bags.

Upon collection we rinsed the resin bags with DI water to remove any soil adhered to the polyester, and extracted the resin bags in 20 mL, 0.5 mol/L HCl for 6 h in a 5 rpm, home-built, end-over-end rotisserie.
HCl extract from the anion bags was analyzed for phosphate and nitrate (after neutralizing extract with NaOH), and extract from the cation bags was analyzed for ammonium on a Scientific Instruments autoanalyzer.

## *Decomposition*

As part of a broader study of the effects of substrate quality vs. site characteristics in controlling decomposition, we measured rates of decomposition of *Metrosideros* litter in three sites along the chronosequence--Thurston, Kohala, and Kokee.
Measurements were also carried out at a location near our Laupahoehoe site, on the same substrate but at 300-m-lower elevation.
We followed the experimental design of @Vitousek1994, except in the present study leaf litter was collected in each site using litter traps rather than by hand, and we used litter bags rather than a tethered-leaf approach.
Nylon bags containing 1 g air-dried litter were distributed among sites as follows: 30 bags were placed in the site where they were collected (hereafter referred to as "in situ litter"); 20 bags from each site were placed in the Thurston site (hereafter "common site"); and 30 bags of leaf litter from the 1855 flow were placed in each of the sites (hereafter "common leaves").
We collected 3-5 litter bags of each type at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo following the start of the measurements.
Decomposition measurements were initiated in January 1992.

Subsamples of the initial material, and all subsequent collections from the field, were oven-dried at 70°C, weighed, and ground.
Samples were acid-digested for N and P analyses in a block digester using a persulfate procedure with a mercuric oxide catalyst; samples for cation analyses were dry-ashed at 550°C, and the residue was taken up in hot nitric acid.
The initial material was also analyzed for lignin and cellulose using the procedure of @VanSoest1968.
Exponential decay constants were calculated by regressing the natural log of fraction mass remaining against time [@Olson1963], and rates of net immobilization or mineralization of nutrients were determined by dividing the mass of an element at any collection (concentration times volume) by the initial content of that element.

In order to compare decay constants (*k*) of the low-elevation (915 m) Laupahoehoe site and the other three sites, we derived a correction factor for the Laupahoehoe site.
We interpolated between *k* values calculated for *Metrosideros* decomposition rates at 915-m and 1550-m sites on a 5000-yr-old a'a lava flow in the Laupahoehoe Forest Reserve (P.M. Vitousek and P. Scowcroft, *unpublished data*).
The correction was *k*$_{1200}$ = 0.78*k*$_{915}$.
Significant differences in mean decay constants were determined based on 95% confidence limits of the regressions.

## *N<sub>2</sub>O flux measurements*

Soil N$_2$O fluxes for the Thurston, Kohala, and Kokee sites were measured by @Riley1995; the measurements for the Laupahoehoe site were added for this study.
A similar static-chamber technique was used for all measurements.
Depending on the sampling date, between 8 and 50 rings (25 cm diameter) were set 1-2 cm in the soil of a site, at least 10 min before sampling.
ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene) chambers were placed over each ring and chambers were sampled 5 times over the course of a 30-min incubation using 10-mL nylon syringes fitted with nylon stopcocks.
Samples were taken to the lab where they were analyzed for N$_2$O on a Shimadzu model 8a gas chromatograph (Columbia, Maryland, USA) fitted with a Porapak-Q column.
Analyses were usually completed within 8 h, with a maximum of 24 h.
Measured N$_2$O concentrations were regressed against sampling times, and fluxes were estimated as the slope of the best-fitting line through the sample data points from each chamber.

## *Vegetation analyses*

We placed five contiguous 20 x 20 m relevés adjacent to and into the study plots on the chronosequence.
At Olaa we placed the five relevés in the area where soil and leaves were sampled.
The vegetation was stratified into structural layers, all vascular plant species present in each layer were identified, and finally the cover values of each species were estimated using Braun-Blanquet's cover-abundance scales [@Mueller-Dombois1974].
In addition, we measured the five tallest *Metrosideros polymorpha* trees in each relevé.

In all sites other than Olaa we measured the diameter at breast height (dbh) of all stems >30 mm of all species in each study plot.
Stem basal area was estimated from dbh measurements.

Species cover-abundance scales were converted to mid-point values [@Mueller-Dombois1974], composited by site, and used for computing mean species values for each site.
This procedure resulted in a data matrix of 6 samples (sites) and 135 taxa.
We applied a detrended correspondence analysis (an indirect ordination) to the matrix using the computer program DECORANA [@Hill1979].
We also applied an unweighted pair group cluster analysis to the 6 samples based on the same matrix (MVSP Plus 2.0; [@Kovach1990]).
These two analyses were performed to investigate relationships among the samples, which were defined by quantitative species composition.

Nomenclature followed @Wagner1990 for flowering plants, and the 1987 checklist by Wagner and Wagner (*unpublished data*) for pteridophytes.
Leaf pubescence is an important character to differentiate *Metrosideros polymorpha* varieties.
We observed some intermediate leaf forms with caducous hairs, and these were identified as the glabrous variety in vegetation analyses.
