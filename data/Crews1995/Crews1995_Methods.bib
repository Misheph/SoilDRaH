  abstract  = {We tested the hypothesis that P was the nutrient limiting net primary production of a native Metrosideros polymorpha forest on a highly weathered montane tropical soil in Hawaii. A factorial experiment used all combinations of three fertilizer treatments: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and a mix of other essential nutrients (OE), consisting primarily of mineral derived cations and excluding N and P. P addition, but not N or OE, increased leaf area index within 12 months, foliar P concentration measured at 18 months, and stem diameter increment within 18 months. Stem growth at 18 months was even greater when trees fertilized with P also received the OE treatment. N and P additions increased leaf litterfall and N and P in combination further increased litterfall. The sequence of responses suggests that increased available P promoted an increase in photosynthetic area which led to increased wood production. P was the essential element most limiting to primary production on old volcanic soil in contrast to the N limitation found on young volcanic soils.},

Total P content of the cultivated soil was 29\% lower than that of the adjacent permanent pasture; the major loss of P (74\% of total P lost) was organic P and residual P. Of the total P lost, 22\% was from the extractable organic P forms, whereas 52\% originated from stable P. Incubation studies were used to study seasonal P transformations during simulated fallow with and without residue incorporation and P fertilization. Nine monthly additions of cellulose (765 µg C · g−1 soil) with and without P (9 µg · g−1 soil) significantly altered levels of total extractable organic P and inorganic P in incubated soils. Evidence is provided for microbial activity playing a major role in redistributing P into different forms in the soil.},

The selection of a suitable method demands a clear statement of objectives that require the soil P measurement. Other considerations include soil properties, sample condition or environment, accuracy and reproducibility, and the facilities, equipment, and personnel available. This chapter enumerates various procedures in detail, including those for total P, organic P, fractionation of soil P and seven indices of P availability. Indirect procedures are used to estimate the total organic P content of soils and are commonly referred to as either extraction or ignition methods. Knowledge of the distribution of soil P among chemical forms should be useful in studies of soil chemistry, soil genesis, soil fertility, and phosphate reactions in lake and river sediments.},

Bray 1 (NH4F + HCl), Mehlich 1 (HCl + H2SO4), Olsen (NaHCO3), and Texas A\&M (NH4Ac + EDTA) soil-P fertility tests and a sequential P fractionation (resin-NaHCO3-NaOH-HCl) were carried out to determine the relative contribution of resin-extractable labile and more stable inorganic and organic P fractions to soil test P in differently weathered soils. A significantly (at the 5\% level) greater amount of Bray 1, Mehlich 1, and Texas A\&M extractable P was attributed to dissolution of Ca-phosphates by the acidic extractants in calcareous compared to highly weathered soils. A shift from Ca- to Al- and Fe-phosphates with increased soil weathering was apparent with Ca-phosphates comprising 55, 17, and 4\% of the total P in calcareous, slightly, and highly weathered soils, while 4, 12, and 20\%, respectively, was associated with Al and Fe in these three soil groups. A significantly larger (at the 5\% level) organic P content was observed in highly weathered (112 mg P kg−1, 26\% of total P) compared to calcareous soils (36 mg P kg−1, 7\% of total P). Correlations between soil test P and P fractions showed that only Olsen P was related (at the 1\% level) to resin P for the calcareous soils, although all tests were closely related to resin P for slightly weathered soils. For the highly weathered soils all tests except Olsen were closely related to resin P. A greater proportion of Bray 1, Mehlich 1, and Texas A\&M P variability was accounted for by organic P fractions in highly weathered (average 17\%) compared to calcareous (average 4\%) and slightly weathered soils (average 1\%). The relationship between organic P and soil test P in uncultivated highly weathered soils is confirmed and this relationship should be carefully considered when evaluating P fertility in these soils.},

The distribution of P across the different fractions (resin, bicarbonate, hydroxide, sonification-2nd hydroxide, acid, and acid-peroxide digest fractions with separate organic and inorganic P determinations) and their relationships to other soil chemical properties were used to evaluate the effects of different soil development on phosphorus composition. Correlation and regression analyses of P distribution and chemical analyses confirmed the partial dependence of organic matter accumulation on available forms of P. Weathering indicators such as base saturation were related to the formation of secondary P forms. The relative proportions of available and stable as well as organic and inorganic P forms were dependent upon soil chemical properties and related to soil taxonomy. Path analysis of relationships between labile and stable P forms showed that in Mollisols much of the labile resin extractable P was derived from inorganic bicarbonate and hydroxide extractable P forms. In more weathered Ultisols, 80\% of the variability in labile P was accounted for by organic P forms, suggesting that mineralization of organic P may be a major determinant of P fertility in these soils.},

During the subsequent bush fallow, fertility levels are improved and the land may be available for further cultivation cycles. In the present study, the effects of cultivation and the regrowth of bush fallow on soil organic matter and phosphorus fertility were evaluated, using adjacent plots with different histories of cultivation and lengths of bush fallow in semi-arid northeastern Brazil. Six years of cultivation with minimal fertilisation resulted in reductions of C, N and organic P by 30%, or about 10 t ha−1 of C. Available N and P were greatly reduced under these conditions. In a fertilised and limed field, this trend was to some extent avoided, but such inputs are usually not an option for local farmers. Eight to 10 years of bush fallow were sufficient to re-establish fertility levels similar to the original uncultivated site. Phosphorus fractionation indicated that the decline in P fertility was not a result of net export of P in the crop, but arises from the mineralisation of organic P and subsequent transformation of the surplus inorganic P to unavailable forms.},

Total P in the soil profile decreased with increasing soil age and was removed from the ecosystem as readily as the most leachable base cations. Although Ca—bound forms of P decreased with increasing soil age, Ca—P remained the singlee largest fraction of total P in all soils. In contrast, Fe— and Al—bound P was a very small percent of total P in all soils. There was little evidence for the stabilization of P by soil organic matter within this ecosystem; both soil organic P and microbial P represented very small pools of total soil P. Phosphorus availability, measured by in situ resin bags, was not well correlated with soil age or total soil P, and P concentrations in shrub tissues did not reflect changes in forms or total amounts of soil P. The biogeochemical cycle of P in this system differs sharply from that in a more mesic, forested system, where fixation by iron and aluminium oxides and biologic activity play more dominant roles in the conservation of P within the ecosystem.},

A sequential extraction procedure was used to measure the different forms of both inorganic (Pi) and organic (Po) phosphorus present in soil horizons. The mobilities of phosphate anions and of some selected (Po) compounds (glucose 6-phosphate, choline phosphate and adenosine triphosphate) were estimated through isotopic dilution kinetic experiments, and indicated that all the tested Po compounds had a higher mobility than phosphate anions in B horizons; also, Po was predominant over Pi in the water extracts from these soils. A mass-balance approach (Pedogenic Index) which incorporates depth-bulk density parameters in measuring the composition of soil horizons was used to calculate losses of Pt and apatite-P (HCl-Pi). Both grassland soils behaved similarly; they lost 500–550 kg P ha−1 (20\%) of their original Pt and 30\% of the initial HCl-Pi fraction was either transformed to various other forms of P or lost from the solum. Losses of Pt (3020 kg P ha−1: 41 \%)and of HCl-Pi (70\%) were much higher in the Gray Luvisol. Since losses of Pt could not be due to leaching of phosphate anions through the profile, the importance of Po in P leaching should be considered along with surface runoff in determining the fate of P in these soils.

The effects of site characteristics were evaluated using three common substrates (Metrosideros leaf litter from one of the sites, wood dowels, and filter paper) decomposed in each of the sites, and the inherent decomposability of tissue (substrate quality) was evaluated using Metrosideros leaf litter from each of the sites decomposed in a common site. Site characteristics were responsible for most of the variation in rates of decomposition in the range of sites and substrates examined. Common substrates decomposed much more rapidly in warm, low elevation sites; apparent Q10 values, calculated on the basis of variation in mean annual temperature with elevation on individual lava flows, ranged from 4 to 11. Litter decomposed slowly in the dry sites, but leaf litter produced in the dry sites decomposed more than twice as rapidly as litter from wet sites when both were measured in the same site. The higher substrate quality of litter from dry sites could be due to trade—offs among nutrient—use efficiency, water—use efficiency, and carbon gain by water—limited Metrosideros. We used these results to test a revision of the CENTURY soil organic matter model that had been designed to simulate the decomposition of surface litter. Simulations accurately matched the pattern but underestimated the magnitude of among—site differences in the decomposition of common substrates in a range of sites. Analyses of both field and simulation results suggested that the decomposition of Metrosideros leaf litter could be limited by nitrogen availability.},

N2O emissions occurred when water—filled pore space (WFPS) values were >40\%, with highest emissions in at least two sites observed at WFPS values of 75\%. Among sites, high NO emissions were associated with high soil N transformation rates. Large NO fluxes were observed only at the Kauai site when WFPS values were <60\%.},
